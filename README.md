# zed-jj-lsp

This is the Zed extension for the [jj-lsp](https://github.com/nilskch/jj-lsp). The extension is not
yet published on the Zed extension registry, so you will need to install it manually as a dev
extension.

## Open TODO's

There are a few things missing before I can release the extension:
- [ ] Create a release pipeline for the jj-lsp (with cross compilation via Github Actions)
- [ ] Add logic to cache and download the jj-lsp binary in this extension
